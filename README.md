# NAPGate Search

On 15.07.2019 hundreds of databases of the Bulgarian tax agency got leacked by a Russian hacker.

This tool allows you to check if you've been affected by the leak based on e-mail or EGN.

## Install
The web app depends on EGN and email lists generated by [napgate](https://github.com/martinsotirov/napgate).

Make sure you have `egn.txt` and `emails.txt` in a folder called `resources`. 

Then you can build the app by running

```
$ cargo build --release
```

or run it directly via

```
$ cargo run
```
